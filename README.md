# AccSwitchBox

This code was written as part of a custom control interface for a racing simulator. The simulator itself has a robust support for keyboard inputs (e.g., you can have keyboard commands for every individual car control value, like Ctrl-1 = TCS 1, etc), which greatly simplified the implementation. Further design details pending (or upon inquiry).
